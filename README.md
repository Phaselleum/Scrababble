# Scrababble

Introducing Scrababble, a 2-player web-based 2-language scrabble-based game created as a coding challenge in 4 days.

Combining scrabble sets from multiple languages and scripts, Scrababble tests your knowledge of multiple languages at the same time.

The experience is nowhere near bug free, cheat resistant or particularly prettily implemented.

Please feel free to use to learn, to improve on the concept and to be inspired by it.


Wordlists are scrabble dictionaries where available, modified regular dictionaries where not. Transliterations are generalised and may not be entirely correct throughout.
